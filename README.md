# React Crash Course

This is the first class of the Introduction to React Course by [@midudev](https://github.com/midudev). You can see the class [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iobxzd_2wY&list=PLUofhDIg_38q4D0xNWp7FEHOTcZhjWJ29&index=1)!

In this class, I created a React component from scratch, specifically the card that recommends who to follow.



## Tech Stack

I made this feature using Vite + React. This project was useful to learn the useState hook. Styles are made using pure CSS.
